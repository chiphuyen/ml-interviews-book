#### 5.1.1 Vectors

_If some characters seem to be missing, it's because MathJax is not loaded correctly. Refreshing the page should fix it._

1. Dot product
    1. [E] Whatâ€™s the geometric interpretation of the dot product of two vectors?
    2. [E] Given a vector $$u$$, find vector $$v$$ of unit length such that the dot product of $$u$$ and $$v$$ is maximum.

2. Outer product
    1. [E] Given two vectors $$a = [3, 2, 1]$$ and  $$b = [-1, 0, 1]$$. Calculate the outer product $$a^Tb$$?
    1. [M] Give an example of how the outer product can be useful in ML.

3. [E] What does it mean for two vectors to be linearly independent?
4. [M] Given two sets of vectors $$A = {a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n}$$ and $$B = {b_1, b_2, b_3, ... , b_m}$$. How do you check that they share the same basis?
5. [M] Given $$n$$ vectors, each of $$d$$ dimensions. What is the dimension of their span?
6. Norms and metrics
	1. [E] What's a norm? What is $$L_0, L_1, L_2, L_{norm}$$?
	1. [M] How do norm and metric differ? Given a norm, make a metric. Given a metric, can we make a norm?
