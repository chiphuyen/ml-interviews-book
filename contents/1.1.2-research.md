### 1.1.2 Research

As the research community takes the “bigger, better” approach, new models often require a massive amount of data and tens of millions of dollars in computing. The estimated market cost to train DeepMind’s AlphaStar and OpenAI’s GPT-3 is in the tens of millions each[^4][^5].  Most companies and academic institutions can’t afford to pursue pure research.

Outside academic institutions, there are only a handful of machine learning research labs in the world. Most of these labs are funded by corporations with deep pockets such as Alphabet (Google Brain, DeepMind), Microsoft, Facebook, Tencent[^6]. You can find these labs by browsing the affiliations of published papers at major academic conferences including [NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, CVPR, ACL](https://www.guide2research.com/topconf/machine-learning). In 2019 and 2020, Alphabet accounts for over 10% of all papers at NeurIPS[[1](https://twitter.com/chipro/status/1170174478304759809/photo/1), [2](https://medium.com/criteo-labs/neurips-2020-comprehensive-analysis-of-authors-organizations-and-countries-a1b55a08132e)].

> 🌳 **Tip** 🌳<br>
Not all these industry labs publish papers -- companies like Apple and Tesla are notoriously secretive. Even if an industry lab publishes, it might only publish a portion of its research. Before joining an industry lab, you might want to consider its publishing policy. Joining a secretive lab might mean that you won’t be able to explain to other people what you’ve been working on or what you’re capable of doing.
